acknowledgments: |
  "The process of my PhD and the production of this thesis was a long a difficult process. During it all, I transitioned genders, moved across the country and changed institutions from Michigan State University to University of California Davis, met my partner and eventual wife, struggled through mental health problems, adopted a family of pets and found a network of close friends, and generally, built a life."
dedication: |
  "*Someone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. But I rather believe than time is a companion who goes with us on the journey, and reminds us to cherish every moment because they'll never come again. What we leave behind is not as important how we lived... after all, Number One, we're only mortal.*"
